# actus-rshiny-demo
This is the repository where we will gather source code for a docker image which is an containerized demo of ACTUS simulationof future cashflows for a portfolio of sample contracts under a selected sample risk scenario. The dmonstration will return plots of projected profit, income and value. 

The current build00 version of the application is just the architecture of the solution: a docker container with a sample RShiny Application  generating a histogram of some randomly generated values. R code to achive the target functions above will be added in a future build
